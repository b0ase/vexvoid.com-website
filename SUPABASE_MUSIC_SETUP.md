# üéµ V3XV0ID Music on Supabase Storage

## Problem Solved

Your music files were in `.gitignore` (correctly, since they're large), but this meant they wouldn't be available when deployed. Now they're stored in Supabase Storage and served via CDN!

## What We Set Up

### 1. **Supabase Storage Bucket**
- Created `v3xv0id-music` bucket in your Supabase project
- Configured for public access with proper RLS policies
- Set up 1-year cache headers for optimal performance

### 2. **Updated Code Structure**
- **`src/app/lib/supabase.ts`** - Supabase client and storage helpers
- **`src/app/lib/musicLibrary.ts`** - Updated to use Supabase URLs with local fallback
- **`src/app/components/MusicPlayer.tsx`** - Now uses Supabase URLs
- **`src/app/components/MusicUploader.tsx`** - UI to upload files to Supabase

### 3. **Upload Process**
1. Visit your site in development mode
2. Click the blue "Upload Music to Supabase" button (bottom right)
3. Click "Upload X Remaining Files" to upload all music at once
4. Files are uploaded from `/public/music/` to Supabase Storage

## How It Works

### Before (Problem)
```
User visits deployed site ‚Üí Requests /music/song.mp3 ‚Üí 404 (file not in git)
```

### After (Solution)
```
User visits site ‚Üí Requests music ‚Üí Supabase CDN serves file ‚Üí Fast streaming
```

## Technical Details

### URLs
- **Local Development**: Falls back to `/music/filename.mp3` if Supabase unavailable
- **Production**: Uses `https://bgotvvrslolholxgcivz.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/v3xv0id-music/filename.mp3`

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Files work when deployed (not in git)
- ‚úÖ Fast CDN delivery worldwide
- ‚úÖ Automatic compression and optimization
- ‚úÖ 1-year browser caching
- ‚úÖ Bandwidth doesn't count against your hosting

### Fallback System
The code tries Supabase first, then falls back to local files for development:

```typescript
export const getAudioUrl = (track: MusicTrack): string => {
  return track.supabaseUrl || track.path;
};
```

## Upload Status

After uploading, you can remove the uploader from the layout:

```typescript
// Remove this line from src/app/layout.tsx after uploading
<MusicUploader />
```

## Your Music Files (24 tracks)

All your atmospheric tracks are configured:
- Echoes series (8 tracks)
- Shadows series (8 tracks) 
- Whispers & Midnight series (4 tracks)
- Shadowed series (4 tracks)

## Next Steps

1. **Upload the files** using the uploader component
2. **Test locally** - music should work from Supabase
3. **Deploy your site** - music will work in production
4. **Remove uploader** from layout once done
5. **Optional**: Set up automated uploads for new music

## Environment Variables

If you want to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://bgotvvrslolholxgcivz.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

Then update `src/app/lib/supabase.ts` to use them.
